      <h3>Our History</h3>
      <p>Founded in 2018 by marine biologist and eco-entrepreneur Alex Waters, <strong>Run for the Oceans</strong> began with a mission to tackle ocean pollution. What started as a small project selling eco-friendly running shoes made from recycled ocean plastics has grown into a global movement. Over the years, we’ve recycled over 5 million pounds of plastic and empowered communities to make sustainable choices. The experience was transformative. Witnessing endangered marine species struggling to survive amidst the plastic wasteland, Alex resolved to turn despair into action.

        Run for the Oceans began as a modest Kickstarter campaign, where Alex and a small team of scientists and designers developed an innovative process to transform ocean plastic into high-performance materials for eco-friendly running shoes. Their flagship product, the Wave Runner 1.0, was an instant hit, selling out within hours and sparking a media frenzy. But the real story was what came next.

        In 2019, the company spearheaded the world’s largest voluntary ocean cleanup effort, mobilizing over 100,000 runners worldwide to collect trash during their daily jogs. The initiative, dubbed "Run and Recover", led to the removal of over 2 million pounds of plastic within its first six months. It wasn’t without challenges—teams encountered everything from rogue waves to territorial sea lions during cleanup dives—but the movement gained unstoppable momentum.

        By 2020, Alex and her team introduced Project Coral Rebirth, reinvesting profits into restoring damaged coral reefs using biocompatible structures made from recycled plastic. Shockingly, they discovered that the same plastics choking marine life could be repurposed to host new ecosystems—reefs that have since become thriving havens for marine biodiversity.

        What shocked the world even more was Alex’s revelation in 2022. During a public keynote, she disclosed that the initial funding for the company had come from an unlikely source: settlements won from lawsuits against major polluting corporations. Alex had covertly documented illegal dumping practices during her marine research and used the evidence to launch a series of class-action lawsuits, winning millions. Instead of lining her pockets, she funneled the money into Run for the Oceans, turning the tide of corporate negligence into a force for good.

        Fast forward to today: Run for the Oceans has recycled over 5 million pounds of plastic, introduced groundbreaking materials that are now industry standards, and inspired a global movement of eco-conscious runners. The brand has redefined not only the shoe industry but also what it means to wear your values—literally. Its mission transcends commerce; it's a battle cry for a planet on the brink of environmental collapse.

        Yet, Alex remains humble, often quoting her team’s mantra: "Every step we take is a ripple in the ocean of change."</p>
